;*************************************************************************************************************************************************
;*****************  These are alternate methods to read the bits in the Morse code LUT. You can use them or not **********************************
;************************************************************************************************************************************************* 
;	Alternate Method #3
; All of the above methods do not use the shift operation properly.
; In the shift operation the bit which is being lost, or pushed off of the register,
; "falls" into the C flag - then one can BCC (Branch Carry Clear) or BCS (Branch Carry Set)
; This method works very well when coupled with an instruction which counts the number 
;  of leading zeros (CLZ) and a shift left operation to remove those leading zeros.
